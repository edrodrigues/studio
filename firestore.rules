/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full
 * control over their own data, and no access to other users' data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, which simplifies ownership checks.
 *  - /users/{userId}/contractModels/{contractModelId}: Contract models created by the user.
 *  - /users/{userId}/filledContracts/{filledContractId}: Filled contracts created by the user.
 *  - /users/{userId}/uploadedDocuments/{uploadedDocumentId}: Documents uploaded by the user.
 *  - /users/{userId}/contractGenerationRequests/{contractGenerationRequestId}: Contract generation requests initiated by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Users can only access data under their own /users/{userId} path.
 *  - Listing collections is allowed only for the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - User ownership is enforced by the path itself (/users/{userId}/...). This avoids the need to store and validate a separate `ownerId` field within the documents and avoids `get()` calls.
